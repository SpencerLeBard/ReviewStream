          <p>
            At ReviewStream, we're transforming how businesses collect and showcase customer reviews. We believe that the 
            feedback process should be simple and accessible for everyone, which is why we've created a text message-based 
            system that makes it easy for customers to share their experiences.

          <h2 className="section-heading">How It Works</h2>
          <p>
            Our platform allows businesses to send personalized text messages to customers asking for their feedback. 
            Customers can respond directly via text with their ratings and reviews. These reviews are then automatically 
            collected and can be displayed on your website through our customizable widgets.
          </p>
          <p>
            The simplicity of texting leads to significantly higher response rates compared to traditional email or web form 
            methods, giving you more authentic feedback to showcase to potential customers.
